# ♟️ Chess Analyzer App

An intelligent web-based application that analyzes thousands of chess games to extract insights, visualize trends, and assist players in improving their strategic understanding.
Developed as part of the **COMP7039 – Agile Processes** module (Autumn 2025).

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Chess Analyzer App** is designed to demonstrate Agile development practices while applying data science and AI to the world of chess.
The system imports, processes, and visualizes large datasets of chess games, providing knowledge extraction through machine learning and LLM-based analysis.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

### **Sprint 1 – Data Input**
- Import chess game datasets (PGN/CSV format)
- Preprocess and clean data (handle missing or invalid values)
- Store structured data in a relational database

### **Sprint 2 – Data Visualization**
- Display processed chess data using tables and charts
- Explore move frequencies, opening trends, and player performance
- Interactive dashboard for filtering and sorting data

### **Sprint 3 – Knowledge Extraction**
- Apply machine learning or communicate with an LLM for intelligent insights
- Identify anomalies, patterns, and strengths in player behavior
- Generate human-readable summaries of player performance
